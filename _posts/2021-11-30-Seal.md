title: HackTheBox Seal Write-up
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

Seal is a medium-rated HackTheBox linux machine. An exposed GitBucket service reveals Apache Tomcat credentials, but I don't have direct access to the manager panel. Instead, I discover
the presence of a reverse proxy which I exploit by abusing the parsing differences between the web servers, allowing access to the manager panel. A backup-creating cron job is exploited
to create a readable copy of luis' ssh key to escalate to this user. Sudo privileges as luis reveals ansible commands may be run as root, allowing me to give /bin/bash setuid permissions
and gaining a root shell.

<h2>Initial Enumeration</h2>

<h2>GitBucket</h2>

Heading over to port 8080 reveals a GitBucket page.

Google reveals GitBucket's default credentials.

These did not work, so instead I registered an account and signed in.

<h3>Tomcat credentials</h3>

I can see there are two webservers listed here.

Knowing Tomcat credentials are in plaintext in a file called tomcat-users.xml, I check root/seal_market/tomcat/tomcat-users.xml. Only the default credentials are shown.

I am not familiar with GitBucket. However, knowing it is probably Git-related, and Git is all about version control, its worth checking for older versions of files.

As is evident from the tomcat GitBucket page, there have been 5 commits in the past.

I check the change history, and am rewarded with tomcat credentials.

I try to log into the manager panel (on port 80), but I am Forbade by the nginx server.

<h3>Multiple servers</h3>

On an earlier page I noticed a ToDo list which provides interesting details.

It suggests the manager panel has not yet been disabled and we may yet be able to access it.

As was revealed earlier, there appears to be two web servers running - nginx and tomcat. Checking the Issues tab reveals correspondence between devs, which seems to suggest nginx is used
as a load balancer.

Checking the server blocks / routes defined by the nginx server can be done by looking at the nginx/sites-available/default file:

```
	location /manager/html {
		if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
			return 403;
		}
		proxy_set_header        Host $host;
		proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		proxy_pass          http://localhost:8000;
		proxy_read_timeout  90;
		proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8000 https://0.0.0.0;
		# First attempt to serve request as file, then
		# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
#		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	}
 
 
	location /admin/dashboard {
		if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
			return 403;
		}
		proxy_set_header        Host $host;
		proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

		# First attempt to serve request as file, then
		# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
#		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	}
 
        location /host-manager/html {
                if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
                        return 403;
                }
                proxy_set_header        Host $host;
                proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_pass          http://localhost:8000;
                proxy_read_timeout  90;
                proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8000 https://0.0.0.0;
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
#               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
 
 
	location / {
                proxy_set_header        Host $host;
                proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_pass          http://localhost:8000;
                proxy_read_timeout  90;
                proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8000 https://0.0.0.0;
}

<h2>Shell as tomcat</h2>

Now that I am able to access the Tomcat manager panel, it is trivial to get a shell. I simply need to create a .war shell and upload and deploy it, catching it on a reverse shell
listener on my attacker machine.



<h2>Shell as luis</h2>



<h3>Sudo privileges</h3>


<h2>Becoming root</h2>
