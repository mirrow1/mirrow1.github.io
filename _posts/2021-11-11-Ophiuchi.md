title: HackTheBox Ophiuchi Write-up
---

Ophiuchi is a Medium-rated Hackthebox linux machine. I gain a foothold via an exposed yaml parser with unrestricted Java methods allowing RCE and a shell as the user tomcat. From there, exposed credentials allow a quick escalation to the user "admin". As admin, I discover I'm able to run a go script as superuser. The file loads scripts without full filepaths allowing script hijacking and command execution as root.
