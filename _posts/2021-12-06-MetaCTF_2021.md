title: MetaCTF 2021 - "Unbreakable Encryption (Crypto)" & "Looking Inwards (Web) Challenge Write-ups"
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

MetaCTF 2021 was a 48-hour live Capture The Flag competition held between 3-5th December. Our team scored 5625 pts placing us at 160th place (top 10%) out of 1932 teams.

In this post I want to detail the solutions to two problems I found particularly fun and interesting. Finally I want to summarize some thoughts and takeaways I got from doing this CTF.

<h4>1. Unbreakable Encryption (Crypto Challenge) (484 solves)</h4>

<strong>Challenge description:</strong>
```There is a form of truly unbreakable encryption: the one time pad. Nobody, not Russia, not China, and not even Steve, who lives in
his mom's basement and hacks governments for fun, can decrypt anything using this cipher... as long as it's used correctly. In this
scheme, a truly random string as long as the plaintext is chosen, and the ciphertext is computed as the bitwise XOR of the
plaintext and the key. However, if the key is reused even once, it can be cracked. We've intercepted some messages between some
criminals, and we're hoping you could crack the one time pad they used. We're pretty sure they reused it, so you should be able to
crack it…

Ciphertext 1: 4fd098298db95b7f1bc205b0a6d8ac15f1f821d72fbfa979d1c2148a24feaafdee8d3108e8ce29c3ce1291
Plaintext 1: hey let's rob the bank at midnight tonight!
Ciphertext 2: 41d9806ec1b55c78258703be87ac9e06edb7369133b1d67ac0960d8632cfb7f2e7974e0ff3c536c1871b
```

This is the first time I'd even heard of Bitwise Exclusive Or ("XOR"), but the challenge description and a bit of research provided me enough information to solve it.

From Wikipedia:

*A bitwise XOR is a binary operation that takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR
operation on each pair of corresponding bits.
The result in each position is 1 if only one of the bits is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1.
In this we perform the comparison of two bits, being 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same.*

Here's an example. Say we want to do the bitwise XOR operation on the first byte of ciphertext 1 (the hex pair `4f`) against the first byte of plaintext 1 (the ascii char `h`).

4f (hex) = 01001111 (binary)

h (ASCII) = 01101000 (binary)

We do the bitwise XOR operation on each corresponding pair of bits.

Performing the bitwise XOR operation involves comparing the two bits: If the pair is different, the resultant bit is 1; if the pair is the same, the resultant bit is 0.

The result we have is `00100111`, which is the first byte of our key.
Then we need to do the same thing for the rest of the bytes of the ciphertext and the plaintext, giving us the full key.
Once we have the full key, we need to reverse the second ciphertext to get the original second plaintext (the flag). The reverse of XOR is XOR, so we apply the same bitwise XOR operation of the bits in the key against the bits in the second ciphertext to get the flag.

For example, when applying the bitwise XOR of the first byte of the key against the first byte of ciphertext 2 (`41`), we get:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/144825815-d1ec5071-effa-48c9-9cc6-d6b53289e8bc.png)

Converting `01100110` back to ASCII gives us `f`, which is the first letter of the unciphered text. All that's left is to do the same for the rest of the unciphered text.

Here's a python script I wrote to do that process.

<details>
  <summary>Click me</summary>
  
```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import math
import re

'''
Steps:

The given ciphertext is in hex, and the plaintext is in ascii obviously.

1. convert the ciphertext to decimals
2. convert the plaintext chars to decimals
3. do bitwise exclusive OR operation to find the characters making up the key
4. use the key to perform another exclusive OR operation against the second ciphertext (XOR is reversible) to get the flag

'''

# 1. convert the ciphertext to decimal list

s = "4fd098298db95b7f1bc205b0a6d8ac15f1f821d72fbfa979d1c2148a24feaafdee8d3108e8ce29c3ce1291"

# first separate the ciphertext to individual hex characters
hex_chars = re.findall('..',s)

cipher_dec = []

# then convert the hex characters to decimals, stored in cipher_dec
for i in range(len(hex_chars)):
	cipher_dec.append(int(hex_chars[i],16))

# 2. convert the plaintext to decimal list

string = "hey let's rob the bank at midnight tonight!"

plaintext_dec = []

for i in string:
	plaintext_dec.append(ord(i))

# 3. do bitwise exclusive OR operation to find the characters making up the key

key = []

# the bin(cipher_dec[i] ^ plaintext_dec[i]) function returns binary characters. We need to change back to decimal
for i in range(0,43):

	key.append(bin(cipher_dec[i] ^ plaintext_dec[i]))

# changing back to decimal. Then we have the key
key_dec = []

for i in key:
	key_dec.append(int(i,2))

# 4. use the key to perform another exclusive OR operation against the second ciphertext (XOR is reversible) to get the flag

# the second ciphertext which we are trying to decrypt
s2 = "41d9806ec1b55c78258703be87ac9e06edb7369133b1d67ac0960d8632cfb7f2e7974e0ff3c536c1871b"

# again split into hex characters
hex_chars2 = re.findall('..',s2)

#convert from hex to decimal
cipher_dec2 = []

for i in range(len(hex_chars2)):
	cipher_dec2.append(int(hex_chars2[i],16))

# do bitwise XOR for each character in the key with each character in the second ciphertext
unciphered = []

for i in range(0,42):
	unciphered.append(bin(key_dec[i] ^ cipher_dec2[i]))

text = []

# (chr(int(i,2))) converts binary > decimal > ascii chars
for i in unciphered:
	text.append(chr(int(i,2)))

flag = "".join(text)

print(flag)

  ```
</details>

It prints `flag is MetaCTF{you're_better_than_steve!}`

*Flag: MetaCTF{you're_better_than_steve!}*

<h4>2. Looking Inwards (Web Challenge) (180 solves)</h4>

This one surprised me by how relatively few solves there were compared to it's difficulty. All that was needed was some light research.

<strong>Challenge description:</strong>
```
It's always fun to take a moment of introspection, in this case not about oneself, but about our field (development/security).
For example when it comes to API design, first there were SOAP endpoints primarily based on XML. Then as Web 2.0 came along,
RESTful APIs became all the rage. Recently, technologies like GraphQL began to gain traction.

With new technologies, though, come new classes of attacks. Check out this basic GraphQL API server. To get you started, here's
one cool thing it can do: If you send it a query in the form of echo(message: "message_here"), it will respond with what you said.
Can you get it to give you the flag?
```

The challenge description provides a link leading to a resource with this JSON response:

From [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting/pentesting-web/graphql#query-__schema-types-name-fields-name), I found this query that extracts all details:

`{"query": "{__schema{types{name,fields{name, args{name,description,type{name, kind, ofType{name, kind}}}}}}}"}`

From that, I'm able to extract the query "super_super_secret_flag_dispenser".

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/144931279-0b215670-57b8-485c-9ebb-741cf389a0b4.png)

If i simply try the query `"query":"{super_super_secret_flag_dispenser}"` I get the message "super_super_secret_flag_dispenser\" argument \"authorized\" of type \"Boolean!\" is required but not provided."

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44827973/144931367-60b64f4a-743e-48fd-8c62-b77c43dccb2d.png)

From the first query it can be seen that "authorized" is an argument you can provide to the query "super_super_secret_flag_dispenser".

From [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69465830/graphql-query-error-message-argument-is-required-but-it-was-not-provided) it looks like what you do is pass the argument in parantheses.

`"query":"{super_super_secret_flag_dispenser(authorized:true)}"`

<h4>Summary and Thoughts on CTFs</h4>

MetaCTF was the third or fourth CTF I've participated in. Early on in the competition, me and my teammate resolved to aim for at least 4000 points and to place in the top 200.
As we're both relatively new to cybersecurity (neither of us work in the field), our final placing far exceeded our expectations and I'm super stoked for that.

Throughout my experiences with CTFs, I've realised my approach towards them is beginning to change. In my first CTF, I would do as much as I can, and would spend a little time but wouldn't get too involved with challenges I felt were out of my depth.

In H@cktivitycon 2021 (which was my second CTF) back in September, I set myself the goal of completing a "Hard" scripting challenge, "Movie Marathon". I think it had around 80 solves by the end. It involved connecting to a server, whereupon the server would send a movie title plus year of release, and to get the flag I would need to send any five actor names back to the server, for 30 movies. My scripting skills were (still are to be honest) pretty basic, but after about five hours of dedicated work, I managed to write a script which worked by sending web requests to Imdb and scraping the top five listed cast. It was janky as hell but it worked, and I got the flag. After talking to the challenge author, he revealed an API which would have made all the scraping unnecessary and simplified the amount of work needed by a ton (I did play around with some APIs but they either didn't have an extensive enough movie database, or were a bit finicky for my liking. I decided web requests would give me better results).

Through my CTF experiences, I felt that persistence has been a greater attribute of success than experience.

I think cracking top 100 / top 5% isn't outside the realm of possibility, and I'd like to see it happen within the coming CTFs!
